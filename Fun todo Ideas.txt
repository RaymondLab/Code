TODO
  - ===== High P =============================================================
    - Order more 9v for Sriram --> Jay
    - buy short BNC cables

    - Run Amins D019 ephys segment
    - Spike sort Boris's data

    - Specific Summary
      - Sriram: OKR-GEN-Vanilla
      - Amin: Gen
    - remove first 5 second of data from Segments

    - Implement drift correction to motors (add back in first 5 in analysis) (which scripts)
    - investigate Yields(); in protocols
    - investigate irregular timing of the d253 lasers

    - Box log in debug
    - Sriram: Recent experiment spike investigate

    - Move experiment Protocols to repository

    - New Spike2 visuals (and change analysis names)

    - Clean + document + Merge dev branch with master branch

  - ===== PROJETS ==============================================================
    - VOR Analysis LOW PRIORITY
      - Integrate DR & DR+GEN into new VOR
      - Subplot titles (main and individual)
      - Params export
      - Automatic detection of frequency
      - desaccading script Review

  - ===== Low P ================================================================
    - GUIDE: Opto
    - GUIDE: Experimental Conditions
    - Tool: Repo Monitoring
    - Tool: Repo Security (ssh)
    - LU: file conflict syntax
    - Why do we recalculate the eye velocity in sineFit? What different from runVOR?




    Things Done Since last J meeting
    Sriram
    - OKR Protocol
    - OKR Analysis
    - OKR+Gen+DEfault Protocol
    - OKR+Gen+DEfault analysis
    - Met with GC people to discuss spike sorting

    Amin
    - Fixed step code in sequencer file
    - Step GC protocol

    Other
    - Solved Drift Issue
    - Improved speed/performance of VOR analysis
    - Improved visuals of subplot
    - sine analysis is now universal! no need for new script for each experiment
    - Application for South Africa Program
    - Calibration debugging (days!)
    - Lab meeting presentation on coding (part 2) (sequencer + spike2 scripting)

    dev & Jenn
    - Helping with access/certification issues
    - Leading them in cleaning out old cables in the rig
    - Leading them in labeling and organizing rig cables.
    - Teach version control and install the repo on Jenn's computer
    - Explaining code, motors, etc.. to them
