Code folders were taken from the D019 computer and 253 computer and placed onto the repository with NO changes.
There is a large amount of redundant code between these two machines, and the version that are already stored on the the Repository.
My goal is to consolidate these three.


============================
ALL ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF D253 CODE AND D019 CODE ARE ON THE REPOSITORY, SIMPLY LOOK TO OLD VERSIONS AROUND JANUARY 28TH 2019
============================


----- Directory -----
smr-import
  son
  importSpike.m
  readSpikeFile.m
dat.m
dragzoom.m


----- Other Information -----
Three Copies
  D019 code
  D253 code
  Located on Repository (original location unknown)


----- dat.m -----
253 v 19:
  Some variable name changes (19:data_in, 253:data).
  Difference in how 'event' channels are detected, minor difference
    253: strcmp(obj(i).samplerate,'event')
    019: ~isnumeric(obj(i).samplerate)
  Additional lines of misc things in D019 code
Repo v 253 & D019:
  Repo contains significant additions.

Decision: Keep Repo version, it appears to be newer, and is the version I already use (I know it is functional)


----- dragzoom.m -----
019 v 253 v repo:
  019: 'crosshair' line 1640
  253: 'fullcrosshair'
  repo: 'crosshair'

Decision: Keep repo version.


----- importSpike.m -----
- d019 contains handling of event channels, newer?
- Repo contains waveform handling that 253, 019 do not

Decision - Keep Repo.


----- readSpikeFile.m -----
- It is consistently the case that the repo version of this code is more recent than either D019 and D253
Decision: Keep repo

----- son folder -----
All are identical

Decision: Keep repo, although it doesn't matter.



----- 
eyetrack folders on D019 & D253 are extremely different. Need to spend more time on them.
